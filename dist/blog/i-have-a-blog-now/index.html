I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have much trouble adhering to them, but I&#x27;m setting them in stone right now so nobody expects anything they won&#x27;t be getting from me here.</p><h2>1. No personal politics</h2><p>Unless a political situation is particularly relevant to myself or my own way of life, there&#x27;s no reason for me to be writing about it on my personal blog. If I must include an explanation of a political situation in order to properly cover a topic, it will be done in as objective a manner as possible. I will try to either keep my personal opinion out of the explanation completely or clearly mark it as such in situations where opinion is unavoidable.</p><h2>2. Sources will be cited where possible</h2><p>I&#x27;d love to put informational and educational content on here occasionally, but that comes with the risk of becoming a source of misinformation. While I cannot guarantee that all of my information will be accurate, I will make an effort to maintain a standard of research and citation (via links, not footnotes; I&#x27;m not an academic). I will, however, add that I am not above using Wikipedia as a quick source as it is basically the <em>Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> but real (also their maintenance standards are definitely higher than mine anyway). Information that is anecdotal or otherwise uncitable will be marked clearly as such. Original content that does not belong to me will also be directly embedded where possible.</p><h2>3. Updates to original posts will be noted</h2><p>This is pretty self-explanatory. I&#x27;ve given myself a 24-hour window to make as many edits to a post as I want. After that, for small edits I will simply replace the text and the most recent update timestamp will be added in the footer. For larger edits that are particularly impactful, I will include an explanation for my edit. Corrections to mistakes in grammar, spelling, and prose will not be noted, nor will adding, removing, or altering links for maintenance purposes.</p><h2>4. I will not adhere to a posting schedule</h2><p>This is for my own sanity, I don&#x27;t want that kind of pressure at all. Also, daily/weekly/otherwise-periodical blogs run the risk of essentially becoming a diary. And I&#x27;m not interested in posting my diary on the internet quite yet. Quality over quantity.</p><p>That is all for now, stay tuned for updates.</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="tags"><em>Tags</em><span>:</span><em>Meta</em></div><em class="updated date"></em></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">
