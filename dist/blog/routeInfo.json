I'm sure you have questions, if you don't have any then I'll pretend you do and try to answer the most obvious ones.\n\n# Why a blog?\n\nTo make a long story short, this exists for two major reasons:\n\n1. I'm sick of traditional social media, but I still want to have some presence on the internet\n2. I needed a place to show off my web-design skills because I, like many, like to eat\n\nA blog is a great way to show off because it shows I can organize a bunch of different information and present it in an easy-to-navigate format on the internet. This is also why I haven't put this all together using a more user-friendly service like Wordpress or Blogger.\n\n## Why not use social media as well?\n\nAlright, get your tin foil hats everybody because we're about to dive into the reason I've been more-or-less absent from social media for the better part of a year now. Ready?\n\nIt doesn't add anything to my life.\n\nSure, there are plenty of reasons I'd prefer to avoid keeping my personal information on third-party websites with infinitely long EULAs that probably let them harvest my internal organs in the night without warning, but I've found a much simpler reason to cut them out of my life. Spending hundreds of hours a year on an infinitely scrolling mobile app that is [tailored to be an addictive experience](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959) isn't a productive use of my time, and as I've come to realize it isn't really even fun. In fact, the tendency of these applications to swing towards tribalism and political extremes was very effective at making me angry with no real way to vent it. I'm a lot happier without that pressure in my life.\n\nI will admit, the one upside of social media is that it allows you to keep up with what's going on in the lives of the people you care about. Part of the reason I've created this blog is to capture some element of that. So if you _really_ want to know what I'm up to, you know where to find me.\n\nI've purposefully designed this blog without any form of direct feedback because I don't want to emulate social media. If you would like to get in contact with me, you can [shoot me an email](mailto:williamkc@wmcasey.com).\n\n# Why now?\n\nWell, frankly I didn't really have the know-how to assemble something like this until very recently. While I've been programming for the better part of six years now, web development is rather new to me and comes with a whole gamut of new technologies to learn and use. Also, at the time of writing I'm about to embark on a study abroad trip that will hopefully give me plenty of reason to fill this place up with content and goodies.\n\n# What will you post here?\n\nI plan to post about all kinds of things. The only post-sorting tool I have implemented at the time of writing is a tagging system. I will give each post a series of tags (listed in the footer) so you can easily navigate by topic. I'm a bit of a serial hobbyist at heart, so there will be plenty of topics to browse through eventually.\n\n# How can I stay updated?\n\nWhen I have time I'll implement RSS and all of that fun stuff. For now, shoot me an email at <mailto:williamkc@wmcasey.com> with the subject line \"Subscribe\" and I'll add you to an email list. Keep in mind none of this is automated yet, I've only really had the time to get this site online and write these introductory posts. Thanks for your patience.\n\n# Do you have any posting guidelines?\n\nI'd like to set myself a few ground rules. I don't think I'll have much trouble adhering to them, but I'm setting them in stone right now so nobody expects anything they won't be getting from me here.\n\n## 1. No personal politics\n\nUnless a political situation is particularly relevant to myself or my own way of life, there's no reason for me to be writing about it on my personal blog. If I must include an explanation of a political situation in order to properly cover a topic, it will be done in as objective a manner as possible. I will try to either keep my personal opinion out of the explanation completely or clearly mark it as such in situations where opinion is unavoidable.\n\n## 2. Sources will be cited where possible\n\nI'd love to put informational and educational content on here occasionally, but that comes with the risk of becoming a source of misinformation. While I cannot guarantee that all of my information will be accurate, I will make an effort to maintain a standard of research and citation (via links, not footnotes; I'm not an academic). I will, however, add that I am not above using Wikipedia as a quick source as it is basically the _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ but real (also their maintenance standards are definitely higher than mine anyway). Information that is anecdotal or otherwise uncitable will be marked clearly as such. Original content that does not belong to me will also be directly embedded where possible.\n\n## 3. Updates to original posts will be noted\n\nThis is pretty self-explanatory. I've given myself a 24-hour window to make as many edits to a post as I want. After that, for small edits I will simply replace the text and the most recent update timestamp will be added in the footer. For larger edits that are particularly impactful, I will include an explanation for my edit. Corrections to mistakes in grammar, spelling, and prose will not be noted, nor will adding, removing, or altering links for maintenance purposes.\n\n## 4. I will not adhere to a posting schedule\n\nThis is for my own sanity, I don't want that kind of pressure at all. Also, daily/weekly/otherwise-periodical blogs run the risk of essentially becoming a diary. And I'm not interested in posting my diary on the internet quite yet. Quality over quantity.\n\nThat is all for now, stay tuned for updates.\n","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"I Have a Blog Now!","url":"i-have-a-blog-now","published":true,"date":"2019-08-27T17:09:00.000Z","update":"","tags":["Meta"],"slug":"i-have-a-blog-now"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"This post is just to detail the technology stack that I used to implement this site. If that interests you, great! Read on! I'll try to add explanations of what each technology is for and links to where you can find them.\n\n# JavaScript, HTML, and CSS\n\nThe Big Three of web development. Here's a quick explanation of each so you'll know what I'm referring to later.\n\n[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (ECMAScript 6) is an interpreted programming language that defines the logic of how a site will act. It handles logic on the frontend (what you see and interact with) as well as the backend (how the site interacts with other servers) admirably. It also comes with a whole suite of libraries and modules that can be easily loaded using the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (bundled with Node.js, another great tool used for server hosting).\n\n[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML 5) is the markup language that is used to define the structure of a webpage. You might have seen tags that look something like <this\\> floating around every now and then. That's HTML. If you right-click on a webpage and choose \"View Source\" you'll see a whole lot of it. Each tag defines an element which can be manipulated either by JS to determine its behavior and/or by CSS to determine its appearance.\n\n[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS 3) is a styling language that lets you define the more advanced visual aspects of a site. You can add borders, define backgrounds, specify fonts, and even change the appearance of something when you hover over it with the mouse.\n\n# React.js\n\n[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library that can be used to build a framework. What that basically means is that I can easily manipulate exactly what content is displayed and change it dynamically. Consider how the list of blogposts changes when you select different tags in the filter on the [main page](/blog). Another major advantage of using a framework is componentization, a concept that lets me reuse code I've already written. For example, each blogpost on this site has the same basic structure (title, body, tags, etc.) which is populated by information when the site creates an instance.\n\nReact actually doesn't use HTML directly, it uses something called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). It looks similar, but it is actually one of the many tools that developers have come up with to be able to change a page's HTML without reloading.\n\nThere are plenty of other frameworks that can achieve these results, but I went with React because it is the [most popular](https://www.npmtrends.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-vs-knockout-vs-ember-source) (and marketable) at the time of writing. Creating this site gave me a good excuse to learn it.\n\n# React Static\n\n[React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static) is a tool for generating static websites given a React application structure. A [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) is one that does not interface with a backend server to serve documents after it is loaded which is an ideal format for a blog site or a landing page. All of the routes (distinct URLs rooted at the domain) are generated and the raw data is fetched when the site is loaded. Each page is created from this data when a route is followed. It also means that my site is built upon the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) guidelines, so it's certifiably hip, rad, trendy, and groovy.\n\nI decided to use React Static in particular as it is the most structure-agnostic tool to do this job. Other static site generators for React such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) prescribe very specific tools and structures that are unique to their environment. With React Static I can use common tools like [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to make my experience with the React technology stack as broadly applicable (and therefore professionally marketable) as possible.\n\n# Netlify CMS\n\nIf you know a lot about this kind of thing, you might be wondering how I am storing the content to be displayed by my website. After all, if I'm not accessing a backend server during runtime, where am I calling all of this blog data from? Surely he's not just storing it all in his Github repository and serving it up via some convoluted system of frontend processing...\n\nWell, that's where [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) comes in, because that's exactly what I'm doing. Netlify CMS is an open-source Content Management System that stores all of a site's related function in the same Git repository where it is stored. This sidesteps the need for a CMS that is accesed via an API, and consequently the need to host such a CMS on a seperate, dedicated server. Not only does this make my load times snappy, but it means I can basically host this website for the cost of the domain.\n\nBasically, on the live website I can navigate to an administration frontend that gives me the ability to manipulate my files graphically. From there I can create markdown documents to structure a blogpost, upload images and other media, and create new entries in data collections. When an update is made, it pushes the changes directly to the site's Github repository. ([Github](https://github.com/) is an online host for Git repositories, which is an indispensible tool for storing code and tracking versions)\n\nIt has a steeper learning curve than most CMSs because you have to define the data collections in a YAML file, and accessing those collections requires some third-party tools like [Gray-Matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and [Klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw), but it's relatively new and getting new features all the time.\n\nWhen I first started building this site, I toyed with the idea of using an API based CMS called [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) (An API is just a way for one piece of sofware to interface with another). It was great (free and open-source too), but when I looked into third party hosting services like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), I realized they're pretty much all blocked in China. At the time of writing I'm about to spend four months there, so I didn't want to deal with that if at all possible.\n\n# Netlify\n\nThis brings me to hosting the site itself. Because I've gone through the effort to use a static-site generator, I can host this site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a static site server that has an excellent pricing plan for small sites like mine: free! When I (or my CMS) push an update to my GitHub repository, Netlify automatically starts building a new version of the site to serve.\n\nTheir Netlify Identity widget integrates smoothly with Netlify CMS so I can access my CMS frontend from anywhere. Netlify is recommended by pretty much everyone for static-site hosting and for good reason. I've also purchased my domain through them.\n\n## Netlify Large Media\n\nIf you're horrified at the prospect of storing hundreds of photos and other media in the same bundle that is served upon loading the site, you can rest easy. Netlify has another service that provides a [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) server which is also part of their free plan as long as I don't upload more than 2500 large media files per month. I'll try to control my shutter finger. Instead of storing the file itself, it stores a pointer to that file in a seperate server. The original media is fetched upon page load.\n\n# Zoho Mail\n\n[Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) is pretty much the quickest and cheapest (it's free) way to receive and send emails using your own domain. It takes some tinkering with DNS records, but they do a good job of walking you through it. The only downside is that mail forwarding is not included in their free plan, so you have to use their front end. It's a good user interface though and has a bunch of API integrations, so I don't have any complaints.\n","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"Tech Specs","url":"tech-specs","published":true,"date":"2019-08-27T18:57:40.294Z","update":"","tags":["Meta","Tech"],"slug":"tech-specs"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"I'm finally getting around to publishing some entries about my study abroad experience. Please hold your applause until the end, thank you.\n\nI was in Shanghai between August and December of 2019 in an effort to make Chinese a little less horrible. During that time I stayed East China Normal University's Zhongbei campus (ECNU/华东师范大学).\n\n# The Campus\n\nECNU has a lovely campus with lots of garden space to enjoy. There are lots of small Shanghainese restaurants in the immediate area in addition to the school having several excellent cafeterias. There are even a few shops on campus where you can grab a quick snack or supplies.\n\n#### ![ECNU](/uploads/img_20191206_155614.jpg \"ECNU\")*ECNU from my dorm floor*\n\nThe program itself was very large and pulled from universities all around the world, so I had the pleasure of being the only American in my class. Zhongbei campus is close to the heart of Shanghai, about a 30 minute metro ride from the Bund, Lujiazui, and Nanjing Road.\n\n#### ![Lujiazui from The Bund](/uploads/mvimg_20191020_213145.jpg \"Lujiazui from The Bund\")*Lujiazui from The Bund*\n\nThe neighborhood around ECNU has several shopping centers as well Changfeng Park (长风公园). Lots of places to explore and enjoy.\n\n# Classes\n\nIt's probably not that surprising that most of my class time was dedicated to language learning. Five days per week (Monday through Friday) I had classes taught in Mandarin from 8:30 - 11:45am. There was a 15 minute break halfway through which I liked to use to grab coffee from the shop across the street.\n\n## Speaking\n\nOn Monday and Wednesday I had speaking class. This mainly focused on new grammar and proper use of the words/grammar I already know. There was also new vocabulary introduced each period. Classes focused rather intensely on naming synonyms/antonyms of known vocabulary, as well as articulating the differences between closely related words and phrases. I really appreciated these lessons even for that reason alone. They were great for cultivating a better command of the language.\n\n#### ![Class building](/uploads/mvimg_20190924_092023.jpg \"Class building\")*Class building*\n\n## Reading/Writing\n\nOn Tuesday and Thursday I had reading/writing class taught in the same room but with a different professor. Much of this class consisted of talking turns from a presentation prepared by the professor. We also had to take weekly dictation tests during which we had to write the new vocabulary as the professor read it aloud. As you might imagine, this isn't as straightforward in Chinese as it is in other languages.\n\n## Listening\n\nFriday mornings were for listening class. Listening to audio tracks and taking short workbook quizzes about them was the main focus of this class.  Sometimes we watched documentaries and listened to music in Mandarin to get a sense of the language as used in different contexts. It was definitely good practice in learning to understand a wide variety of voices.\n\n#### ![Ginger Chicken Soup](/uploads/img_20191019_130453_exported_stabilized_178720828601232833.gif \"Ginger Chicken Soup\")*Ginger Chicken Soup*\n\n## Philosophy\n\n*One of these things is not like the others!*\n\nI had extra time to take an English language class, so I decided on Chinese Philosophy! For a diehard STEM aficionado, I do really like dabbling in philosophy when I can. Most classes I can take back at home barely even touch on the existence of the Eastern half of the tradition though, so I was very excited to have the opportunity. The class covered the core texts, tenets, and philosophers of China's major philosophical schools: Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, Legalism, and Chinese Buddhism. This class also really helped me to contextualize a lot of the more historical areas I visited during the trip.\n\n# Housing\n\nHousing was initially tough to sort out. I registered for my dorm over the summer, but what I didn't know at the time was that the full housing payment would be due up front. In cash. That threw a wrench in my plans for a couple of days. If you're feeling daring, you should try traveling halfway around the world and pulling a huge wad cash out of an ATM just to see what happens. It doesn't help that China's largest bill is worth about $14 at the time of writing.\n\n#### ![Dorm View](/uploads/mvimg_20190829_044435.jpg)*View from my dorm*\n\nIt took a few days to get the money, but I was able to placate the receptionist with a deposit in the meantime. Here are some pics of the room. I'd tell you the mess was from unpacking, but it never looked much nicer than this so that would just be a lie.\n\n#### ![My dorm](/uploads/mvimg_20190901_141543.jpg \"My dorm\")\n\nIn the end I was placed in a dorm on the 11th story of one of the exchange student dorms on campus with a roommate from Japan. Plenty of amenities including a private bathroom and laundry facilities.\n\nI had a great time in China and I'm happy to be getting around to posting these updates! More to come on the less academic aspects of the trip, enjoy!","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"Study Abroad","url":"study-abroad","published":false,"date":"2020-04-08T13:52:23.205Z","update":"","thumbnail":"/uploads/img_20191206_155614.jpg","tags":["Travel","China Study 2019"],"slug":"study-abroad"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}],"tags":[{"content":"","data":{"value":"China Study 2019","published":true,"slug":"China Study 2019"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"DIY","published":false,"slug":"DIY"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"Language","published":false,"slug":"Language"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"Meta","published":true,"slug":"Meta"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"Music","published":false,"slug":"Music"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"Outdoor","published":false,"slug":"Outdoor"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n","data":{"value":"Tech","published":true,"slug":"Tech"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"","data":{"value":"Travel","published":true,"slug":"Travel"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}]},"path":"blog"}
