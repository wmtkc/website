Yep, I've finally gone and made my own little corner of the internet. I'm sure you have questions, if you don't have any then I'll pretend you do and try to answer the most obvious ones.

# Why a blog?

To make a long story short, this exists for two major reasons:

1. I'm too good for traditional social media, but I still need a place to virtue signal on the internet
2. I needed a place to show off my web-design skills because I, like many, like to eat

A blog is a great way to show off because it shows I can organize a bunch of different information and present it in an easy-to-navigate format on the internet. This is also why I haven't put this all together using a more user-friendly service like Wordpress or Blogger.

## Why not use social media as well?

Alright, get your tin foil hats everybody because we're about to dive into the reason I've been more-or-less absent from social media for the better part of a year now. Ready?

It doesn't add anything to my life.

Sure, there are plenty of reasons I'd prefer to avoid keeping my personal information on third-party websites with infinitely long EULAs that probably let them harvest my internal organs in the night without warning, but I've found a much simpler reason to cut them out of my life. Spending hundreds of hours a year on an infinitely scrolling mobile app that is [tailored to be an addictive experience](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959) isn't a productive use of my time, and as I've come to realize it isn't really even fun. In fact, the tendency of these applications to swing towards tribalism and political extremes was very effective at making me angry with no real way to vent it. I'm a lot happier without that pressure in my life.

I will admit, the one upside of social media is that it allows you to keep up with what's going on in the lives of the people you care about. Part of the reason I've created this blog is to capture some element of that. So if you _really_ want to know what I'm up to, you know where to find me.

I've purposefully designed this blog without any form of direct feedback because I don't want to emulate social media. If you would like to get in contact with me, you can shoot me an email.

# Why now?

Well, frankly I didn't really have the know-how to assemble something like this until very recently. While I've been programming for the better part of six years now, web development is rather new to me and comes with a whole gamut of new technologies to learn and use. Also, at the time of writing I'm about to embark on a study abroad trip that will hopefully give me plenty of reason to fill this place up with content and goodies.

# What will you post here?

I plan to post about all kinds of things. The only post-sorting tool I have implemented at the time of writing is a tagging system. I will give each post a series of tags (listed in the footer) so you can easily navigate by topic. I'm a bit of a serial hobbyist at heart, so there will be plenty of topics to browse through eventually.

# Do you have any posting guidelines?

I'd like to set myself a few ground rules. I don't think I'll have much trouble adhering to them, but I'm setting them in stone right now so nobody expects anything they won't be getting from me here.

## 1. No personal politics

Unless a political situation is particularly relevant to myself or my own way of life, there's no reason for me to be writing about it on my personal blog. If I must include an explanation of a political situation in order to properly cover a topic, it will be done in as objective a manner as possible. I will try to either keep my personal opinion out of the explanation completely or clearly mark it as such in situations where opinion is unavoidable.

## 2. Sources will be cited where possible

I'd love to put informational and educational content on here occasionally, but that comes with the risk of becoming a source of misinformation. While I cannot guarantee that all of my information will be accurate, I will make an effort to maintain a standard of research and citation (via links, not footnotes; I'm not an academic). I will, however, add that I am not above using Wikipedia as a quick source as it is basically _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ but real (also their maintenance standards are definitely higher than mine anyway). Information that is anecdotal or otherwise uncitable will be marked clearly as such. Original content that does not belong to me will also be directly embedded where possible.

## 3. Updates to original posts will be noted

This is pretty self-explanatory. I've given myself a 24-hour window to make as many edits to a post as I want. After that, for small edits I will simply replace the text and the most recent update timestamp will be added in the footer. For larger edits that are particularly impactful, I will include an explanation for my edit. Corrections to mistakes in grammar, spelling, and prose will not be noted, nor will adding, removing, or altering links for maintenance purposes.

## 4. I will not adhere to a posting schedule

This is for my own sanity, I don't want that kind of pressure at all. Also, daily/weekly/otherwise-periodical blogs run the risk of essentially becoming a diary. And I'm not interested in posting my diary on the internet quite yet. Quality over quantity.
